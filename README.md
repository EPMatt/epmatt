## Hi there, I'm Matteo 👋

I'm a Software Developer and Computer Science student based in Venice, Italy. 🇮🇹

- 📚 I’m studying for a **BSC in Computer Science** at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.
- 🔭 I’m mainly working on full stack web development with modern tools such as **React** and **TypeScript**.
- 🌱 I love to help and share my knowledge and expertise with others. I enjoy working on Open Source and helping people getting the most from my contributions.
- 🏠 My activity is usually focused but not limited to [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) related projects. I'm the **founder and maintainer of [Awesome HA Blueprints](https://github.com/EPMatt/awesome-ha-blueprints)**.
- 🤖 I also enjoy designing complex and highly automated CI/CD pipelines with the **GitHub Actions** ecosystem.
- 📷 I’m a free time **photographer** and **videomaker**.
- 🎹 I love **playing the piano**!
