## Hi there, I'm Matteo 👋

I'm a Software Engineer based in Zurich (Switzerland 🇨🇭), with a strong interest in cybersecurity, web development and entrepreneurship.

- 📚 I’m studying for a **M.Sc. in Computer Science** at ETH Zurich.
- 🔭 I’m mainly working on full stack web development with modern tools such as **React** and **TypeScript**.
- 🌱 I love to help and share my knowledge and expertise with others. I enjoy working on Open Source and helping people getting the most from my contributions.
- 🏠 My activity is usually focused but not limited to [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) related projects. I'm the **founder and maintainer of [Awesome HA Blueprints](https://github.com/EPMatt/awesome-ha-blueprints)**.
- 🤖 I also enjoy designing complex and highly automated CI/CD pipelines with the **GitHub Actions** ecosystem.
- 📷 I’m a free time **photographer** and **videomaker**.
- 🎹 I love **playing the piano**!
